        <h2>We're sorry, our server broke. (HTTP 500)</h2>
        <p>
          Something went terribly wrong with your request (&quot;[path]&quot;).
        </p>
        <p>
          You probably got to this page by requesting  &quot;/haltandcatchfire&quot;. This is the <em>production</em> result page for an Internal Server Error. This was raised because the requested <code>PageMaker</code> method generated an error (though it also happens when no route is defined for a request).
        </p>
        <p>The <code>InternalServerError</code> method from <code>uweb.DebuggingPageMaker</code> has been overridden here to bring you this somewhat user-friendly page. For the raw debugging page, this method has a check for the presence of <em>debug</em> in the query string. Give it a try: <a href="?debug">debug HTTP 500</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Oh and yeah, ff you got this response for any request other than <a href="/haltandcatchfire">/haltandcatchfire</a>, that's a bug and we'd like to know about this.</p>
